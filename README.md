<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
This repository was created as part of a Big Data project in which services must be consumed from a database made in MondoDB with the historical information of the `flights of US airlines`. This project was designed to work as a front-end for the [Netlify Serverless](https://github.com/TheWorstOne/netlify-serverless) repo. Check the [Demo](https://simplemongo-crud.web.app/flight-history)!
